## cấu trúc ứng dụng Express.js

It looks like you're asking about structuring your Express.js application, specifically whether you can split it into separate files using classes and whether you can use `async/await` within your route handlers.

The short answer to both of your questions is yes, you can.

## 🏗️ Structuring Your Application

Yes, you can absolutely split your project into smaller, more manageable files by passing the `app` variable to different classes or modules. This is a common and recommended practice for building scalable applications, as it helps separate concerns and makes your code easier to maintain and test.

A typical approach involves creating a separate module for your routes. You can then import the Express `app` instance into that module and define your routes there. For example, you could have a `routes/auth.js` file:

**`routes/auth.js`**

```javascript
import { LoginController } from '../controllers/LoginController.js';
import { AuthMiddleware } from '../core/AuthMiddleware.js';

export default function registerAuthRoutes(app) {
    const authMiddlewareInstance = new AuthMiddleware();

    app.post('/auth-login/', (req, res) => {
        const loginControllerInstance = new LoginController(req, res);
        loginControllerInstance.login();
    });

    app.get('/auth-check/', authMiddlewareInstance.authCheck, (req, res) => {
        res.status(201).json({ authCheck: true });
    });

    app.get('/auth-logout/', (req, res) => {
        const loginControllerInstance = new LoginController(req, res);
        loginControllerInstance.logout();
    });
}
```

Then, in your main `server.js` file, you would import this function and call it, passing the `app` instance:

**`server.js`**

```javascript
// ... (all your existing imports and middleware setup)
import registerAuthRoutes from './routes/auth.js';

// ... (your existing app setup code)

registerAuthRoutes(app);

// ... (your app.listen() call)
```

This method keeps your main server file clean and focused on server configuration, while your routes are organized logically in separate files. You can create different route files for different parts of your application, like `users.js`, `products.js`, etc.

## 💻 Using `async/await` in Route Handlers

Yes, you can use `async/await` within your `app.get()`, `app.post()`, or any other route handlers. Express supports asynchronous functions out of the box.

To use `await` inside a route handler, you simply need to make the function **`async`**. For example, if your `login()` method is asynchronous, you would declare the route handler as `async` and `await` the result.

**`server.js` (updated route handler)**

```javascript
app.post('/auth-login/', async (req, res, next) => {
    try {
        const loginControllerInstance = new LoginController(req, res);
        await loginControllerInstance.login(); // Assuming login() is now an async function
    } catch (error) {
        next(error); // Pass errors to the Express error-handling middleware
    }
});
```

Using `async/await` is a great way to handle operations that take time, like database queries or API calls, as it makes your asynchronous code look and feel synchronous, which improves readability. You should always use a `try...catch` block with `async/await` to handle any potential errors, and it's good practice to pass any caught errors to the `next()` function, which lets Express's built-in error handling take over.

Using these techniques will make your codebase more organized and robust. Does this help with what you're trying to build?
