Yes, you can use `await import()` to dynamically import modules, and you can control when to call `registerAuthRoutes(app)`. This is a useful technique for **lazy-loading** routes or for importing them conditionally.

### **Using `await import()`**

The `await import()` syntax is part of ECMAScript modules (ESM) and allows you to load a module asynchronously. It returns a **Promise** that resolves to the module namespace object.

Here's how you can use it in your code:

```javascript
// server.js
// This route handler will load the auth routes only when someone accesses /load-auth
app.get('/load-auth', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const authModule = await import('./routes/auth.js');
        // The imported module is an object, so you access the default export
        const registerAuthRoutes = authModule.default; 
        
        // Now you can call the function to register the routes
        registerAuthRoutes(app);

        res.status(200).send('Authentication routes loaded and registered!');
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to load auth routes:', error);
        res.status(500).send('Error loading auth routes.');
    }
});
```

The key differences are:

  * `import registerAuthRoutes from './routes/auth.js';` is a **static import**. The module is loaded and executed when the `server.js` file starts.
  * `const authModule = await import('./routes/auth.js');` is a **dynamic import**. The module is only loaded when the `await import()` line is executed. The `authModule` object will contain all the exports from `routes/auth.js`, so you need to access the `default` export.

-----

### **Registering Routes "When Needed"**

You can use this dynamic import inside a route handler or any asynchronous function to load and register the routes on demand.

In the example above, the authentication routes (`/auth-login`, `/auth-check`, etc.) **are not registered** when the server starts. They are only added to your Express app's router *after* a client makes a `GET` request to `/load-auth`.

This is an effective way to implement lazy loading. The code for the authentication routes is not loaded into memory until it's actually required, which can help reduce your application's initial startup time and memory footprint, especially in large applications with many different route modules.

However, be aware that once the routes are registered, they will remain in the app's router for the lifetime of the application instance. The dynamic import just controls **when** that registration happens, not whether it can be unregistered later.
